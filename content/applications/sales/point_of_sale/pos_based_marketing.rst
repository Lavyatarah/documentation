Here is the basic flow for storing contact details:
===================================================

-   Open the Point of Sale session.
-   Make an order and validate it.
-   If the partner is selected, their contact details will be stored in the PoS order.
-   If the partner is not selected, the contact details will be stored after sending the receipt from the receipt screen
    via Email, SMS and WhatsApp.
